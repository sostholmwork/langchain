# Prompts

A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to
guide the model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant
and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences,
or engaging in a conversation.

LangChain provides several classes and functions to help construct and work with prompts.

- [Prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/): Parametrized model inputs
- [Example selectors](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/): Dynamically select examples to include in prompts
