# LangChain Expression Language

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

LangChain Expression Language is a declarative way to easily compose chains together.
Any chain constructed this way will automatically have full sync, async, and streaming support.
See guides below for how to interact with chains constructed this way as well as cookbook examples.
